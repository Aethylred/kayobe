    Support for configuring an NTP daemon on the seed and overcloud hosts is no
    longer present for CentOS 8, as appropriate packages are not available.
    Instead, Kolla Ansible is configured to deploy the ``chrony`` container on
    overcloud hosts by default. This may be disabled by setting
    ``kolla_enable_chrony`` to ``false``.
