    # NOTE(mgoddard): CentOS 8 removes interfaces from their bridge during
    # ifdown, and removes the bridge if there are no interfaces left. When
    # Kayobe bounces veth links plugged into the bridge, it causes the
    # bridge which has the IP we are using for SSH to be removed. Use a
    # dummy interface.
